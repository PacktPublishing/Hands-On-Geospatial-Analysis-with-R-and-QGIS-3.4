# Hands-On Geospatial Analysis with R and QGIS 3.4 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Geospatial Analysis with R and QGIS 3.4 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hands-geospatial-analysis-r-and-qgis-34-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789950052), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This course introduces you to the full workflow from acquiring data, data wrangling and analysing to outputting and publishing visualisation products. We will touch on a variety of datasets including remote sensing data and techniques to incorporate machine learning in the analytical steps in QGIS. We will further investigate geospatial analysis using the most up-to-date R packages such as ggplot2, raster, sf, Leaflet and Shiny.
By the end of the course, you will be able to produce interactive maps and professional cartographic products, deploy them as a Shiny application, and critique on a variety of end-results.
